Based on the average audio characteristics of the 100 most-played songs (such as danceability, energy, and valence), a listener's audio mood in 2018 may have favored high-energy, positive, and danceable music. However, this method can be distorted because it ignores the weight of actual play frequency (songs played on repeat should be more representative) and is susceptible to outliers. A better calculation should include weighted averages based on play count, cluster analysis of the proportion of different music genres, and examination of time-series changes to more accurately reflect listeners' true preferences.
